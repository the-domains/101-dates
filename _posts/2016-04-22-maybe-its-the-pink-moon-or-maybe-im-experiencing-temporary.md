Maybe it's the pink moon or maybe I'm experiencing temporary insanity due to the sheer volume of individuals available at my thumb-tip but I've decided that after dating every type of man from Olympian to famous overdosed actor, Royalty to humanitarian, fireman to wildly successful international superstar, I should probably write a blog. So here it is, folks. A safe-ish space to share more than a decade of my deepest, darkest dating data.

I've been around the block and learned a thing or two having dated literally every type of guy (and the occasional hot chick too) and despite the incessant advice that "you'll find love when you stop looking for it," I assure you that no stone or dating website/app has been left unturned. Ok, fine, I've never tried the farmers only website, because I happen to prefer the crop of eligible urban jungle singles, but besides that, I've got this handled. Here's to hoping that the important life lessons I've acquired through pain and pleasure will somehow positively have an impact on you...ya know, like the cycles of the moon or whatever. Pink moon or no pink moon, something is in the air. Time to let down my hair and start sharing.

Yours Truly,

Scarlett X

\*Side-note, I actually do believe that astrological forces have an impact on human emotions and well...life on the planet in general, but the trendiness of being "spiritual" these days or use of astrology as a form of escapism is why I have to make fun of myself when using it as reference, which is likely to happen frequently. If I may make a humble suggestion, when you ask someone what their sign is, start doing it with an accent. I prefer British, Valley Girl and Southern, but test it out and see what works best for you. 

Because spirituality is beginning to rank up there with the flannel wearing, man-bunned, bearded lumberjack model type thing, being playful about it rather than making someone's astrological compatibility a life or death scenario may help you come across as endearing rather than dogmatic. So if you meet someone you're into who isn't your soulmate sign according to some book you read or what some guru tells you--no matter how famous they are--you WILL survive.
